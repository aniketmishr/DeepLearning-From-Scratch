# Deep Learning From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of famous deep learning architectures built from scratch, along with explanations of key deep learning concepts. The goal is to provide a structured approach to understanding and implementing deep learning models without relying on high-level frameworks.

## How to Use This Repo
- Each deep learning model is inside the `architectures/` folder with its corresponding code and documentation.
- The `topics/` folder covers theoretical explanations and implementations of key deep learning concepts.
- If you are looking for practical implementations, check the `notebooks/` directory.
- Reusable functions like activation functions and optimizers are in `utils/`.
