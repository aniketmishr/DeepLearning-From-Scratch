# DeepLearning From Scratch

> Rebuilding the foundations of modern AI — from first principles.

This repository is a long-term, structured effort to deeply understand the core ideas that power modern Artificial Intelligence.  
Every architecture implemented here is rebuilt from the ground up with minimal abstraction, focusing on **mathematical clarity, algorithmic understanding, and implementation-level intuition**.

The goal is not just to make models work — but to understand *why* they work.

## Philosophy

Modern deep learning frameworks make it easy to use powerful models.  
This repository exists to understand them.

Each implementation follows three principles:

1. **First Principles** — Derivations before code.
2. **Minimal Abstraction** — No unnecessary high-level shortcuts.
3. **Clarity Over Convenience** — Readability and conceptual transparency come first.

This is a study of the mechanics behind deep learning — gradients, optimization, architectures, and the mathematical structure underlying them.

## What This Repository Contains

- Re-implementations of influential deep learning papers  
- Mathematical derivations and conceptual explanations  
- Clean, modular implementations of core architectures  
- Structured experiments and notebooks for deeper exploration  

Over time, this repository will grow into a comprehensive collection of:

- Foundational models (MLP, CNN, RNN, Transformers, etc.)
- Optimization techniques
- Regularization methods
- Architectural innovations
- Key research milestones in deep learning

## Why This Exists

- To develop intuition beyond surface-level usage.
- To bridge theory and implementation.
- To build research-level understanding of AI systems.
- To document the journey of mastering deep learning from the ground up.

This repository is both:
- A personal laboratory for serious study  
- A public portfolio of disciplined, principle-driven learning

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aniketmishr/DeepLearning-From-Scratch.git
cd DeepLearning-From-Scratch
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Explore

Start with the `architectures/` directory to examine implementations.
Use the `notebooks/` directory for guided experimentation.

## Long-Term Vision

This is not a short-term project.
It is an evolving body of work aimed at mastering the foundations of intelligent systems.

The ambition is simple:

> Understand deep learning — not as a user, but as a builder.
