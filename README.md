# Deep Learning From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of famous deep learning architectures built from scratch, along with explanations of key deep learning concepts. The goal is to provide a structured approach to understanding and implementing deep learning models without relying on high-level frameworks.

## How to Use This Repo
- Each deep learning model is inside the `architectures/` folder with its corresponding code and documentation.
- If you are looking for practical implementations, check the `notebooks/` directory.


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aniketmishr/DeepLearning-From-Scratch.git
   cd DeepLearning-From-Scratch
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore different models and concepts through the provided scripts and notebooks.
